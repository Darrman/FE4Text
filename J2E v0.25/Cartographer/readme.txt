1.	Translation History

Stove worked on it, stopped.  Tiger Claw worked on it, stopped.  STove
worked on it again, and so did Tiger claw.  They realized they were both
working on it and worked together.  Jay joined, and with his super-nifty
powers, cracked compression, found tables, made inserters, etc. etc..
Tiger left, Jay left, STove all alone again.  Help stove.. help him.. :)
